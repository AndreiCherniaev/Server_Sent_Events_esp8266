# Server_Sent_Events_esp8266
 Server-Sent Events: пример использования
 
push.html
push.ino    sketch for ESP8266


Demonstrates pushing data from a small webserver on an ESP8266
To a modern browser running push.html


In our experience not suitable for realtime fast data,
but excellent for irregular updates (reconnects well after ESP-offline time)

Do not forget to substitute your ipnr and port in html and ssid and password in sketch
